# Headline + Image Single Page Site

This is an extremely one-page website. Fully configured, its only external dependencies are a favicon and share preview image. Most of the time, this isn't the best way to set up a website. But if you're in a hurry, and/or only putting up one page, it's a great way to get going quickly.
